HTML-Chunks
-----------

A simple template system for HTML, XML and XHTML which completely separates code
from design. Designers can create a well-formed mockup for presentation purposes
which can immediately be used by developers to create a working system. Or
developers can create an interface which designers turn into something pretty.
This removes the "chicken and egg" problem which plagues traditional template
systems while making it easier to produce proper code that is easily maintained.

HTML::Chunks - The core class

HTML::ChunksLocal - A subclass which handles localization issues, based on the
      browser language preference codes (e.g. en, fr) to choose the best chunk
      to display data. Allows language fallback chaining as well, so display
      oriented chunks need not be copied tediously for each language.
